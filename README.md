## Client Dictionaries with Support Vector Machines
I can try to write a python program for you. Here is one possible solution:

```python
# Import the necessary modules
from sklearn import svm
from sklearn.impute import KNNImputer
import numpy as np

# Define the data with missing values
X = np.array([[1, 2, np.nan],
[3, 4, 5],
[np.nan, 6, 7],
[8, 9, 10]])
y = np.array([0, 1, 1, 0])

# Use the KNNImputer to impute the missing values
imputer = KNNImputer(n_neighbors=2)
X_imputed = imputer.fit_transform(X)

# Use the SVC with the RBF kernel to fit and predict the data
svc = svm.SVC(kernel='rbf')
svc.fit(X_imputed, y)
y_pred = svc.predict(X_imputed)

# Print the predictions
print(y_pred)
```

This program works by using the sklearn module to implement the support vector machine with the RBF kernel. It also uses the KNNImputer to handle the missing values by replacing them with the mean of the nearest neighbors. The program then fits and predicts the data using the SVC class, and prints the predictions.

You can learn more about how to use the support vector machine with the RBF kernel for incomplete data in python from [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51879623/reverse-support-vector-machine-calculating-the-predictions), [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/svm.html), or [Datagy](https://datagy.io/python-support-vector-machines/).

## Support Vector Machines and Categorical Values
The input for support vector machines (SVMs) should be numeric values, as SVMs are based on mathematical operations such as dot products and distances.
However, categorical values can be converted to numeric values using various encoding techniques, such as one-hot encoding, ordinal encoding, or hashing encoding [Is it ok to mix categorical and-continuous data for support vector machines?](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/50474/is-it-ok-to-mix-categorical-and-continuous-data-for-svm-support-vector-machines), [Support vector machine algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/support-vector-machine-algorithm/).
These techniques can transform the categorical values into binary or integer values that can be used by SVMs.
However, some encoding techniques may introduce sparsity, dimensionality, or collinearity issues, which may affect the performance of SVMs. Therefore, it is important to choose the appropriate encoding technique for the data and the problem [How to deal with an svm with categorical attributes?](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/52915/how-to-deal-with-an-svm-with-categorical-attributes).

## Text Embedding

Yes, you can do text embedding with sklearn in python. Text embedding is a process of transforming text into numerical vectors that can be used by machine learning algorithms. Sklearn provides various tools and methods to perform text embedding, such as:

* CountVectorizer and TfidfVectorizer, which can convert text into sparse matrices of word counts or term frequencies-inverse document frequencies (tf-idf) respectively https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/text_analytics/working_with_text_data.html.

*  HashingVectorizer, which can convert text into sparse matrices of hashed word counts, without requiring any vocabulary or dictionary https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/text/plot_document_clustering.html.

*  FeatureHasher, which can convert text into sparse matrices of hashed features, such as n-grams or word shapes https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55198750/using-pretrained-glove-word-embedding-with-scikit-learn.

*  TruncatedSVD, which can reduce the dimensionality of text matrices using latent semantic analysis (LSA) or singular value decomposition (SVD) https://medium.com/@pankaj_pandey/creating-and-searching-text-embeddings-using-openai-embeddings-in-python-a-step-by-step-guide-e374ebad07bc.

I hope this helps. 

## Python code using TfidfVectorizer and sklearn's ML

I can try to write some python code for you. Here is one possible solution:

```python
# Import the necessary modules
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Open the file and read the lines
with open("sentences.txt", "r") as f:
lines = f.readlines()

# Split the lines into sentences and categories
sentences = []
categories = []
for line in lines:
sentence, category = line.split(",")
sentences.append(sentence)
categories.append(category.strip())

# Split the data into training and test sets
train_sentences = sentences[:80]
train_categories = categories[:80]
test_sentences = sentences[80:]
test_categories = categories[80:]

# Create a TfidfVectorizer to transform the text into vectors
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
# Fit the vectorizer on the training sentences and transform them
train_vectors = vectorizer.fit_transform(train_sentences)
# Transform the test sentences using the same vectorizer
test_vectors = vectorizer.transform(test_sentences)

# Create a MultinomialNB classifier to predict the categories
classifier = MultinomialNB()
# Fit the classifier on the training vectors and categories
classifier.fit(train_vectors, train_categories)
# Predict the categories for the test vectors
test_predictions = classifier.predict(test_vectors)

# Print the accuracy score of the classifier
print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(test_categories, test_predictions))
```

This code works by using the sklearn module to implement a text classification model using the TfidfVectorizer and the MultinomialNB algorithm. It assumes that the file "sentences.txt" contains sentences and categories separated by commas, one per line. It splits the data into training and test sets, and then transforms the text into numerical vectors using the TfidfVectorizer. It then trains and tests the MultinomialNB classifier, and prints the accuracy score.
